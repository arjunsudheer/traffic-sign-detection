# German Traffic Signs Detection Benchmark Dataset Credits
I used the [GTSDB - German Traffic Sign Detection Benchmark](https://universe.roboflow.com/vrobot8182-163-com/gtsdb-nzh3w/dataset/4) dataset for object detection research. This dataset was found on [Roboflow](https://universe.roboflow.com/).
