# German Traffic Signs Recognition Benchmark Dataset Credits
I used the [GTSRB - German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/meowmeowmeowmeowmeow/gtsrb-german-traffic-sign/data) dataset for image classification research. This dataset was found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/), and was published by Mykola.
